## 🏗️ Dual Workflow Architecture

### Active Development Workspace
```
Location: C:\Users\thoma\Downloads\bitburner\bitburner-remote-api\src\

Purpose:
- Daily coding and testing
- Quick iterations
- Fast feedback loop

Speed: ⚡ Instant sync (< 2 seconds)

Structure:
├── analysis/
│   ├── profit-scan-flex.js
│   ├── profit-scan.js
│   └── production-monitor.js
├── batch/
│   ├── simple-batcher.js
│   └── batch-manager.js
├── core/
│   ├── attack-hack.js
│   ├── attack-grow.js
│   └── attack-weaken.js
├── deploy/
│   ├── auto-deploy-all.js
│   ├── purchase-server-8gb.js
│   └── ...
└── utils/
    ├── global-kill.js
    ├── list-procs.js
    └── ...
```

### Version Control Workspace
```
Location: C:\Users\thoma\Downloads\bitburner\scripts\

Purpose:
- Version control and history
- Backups and safety net
- Sharing via GitHub
- Distribution via bitburner-update.js

Speed: 🐢 Manual (60-120 seconds)

Structure: (Same as Remote API workspace)
├── analysis/
├── batch/
├── core/
├── deploy/
└── utils/
```

## 📝 Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (2 minutes)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\thoma\Downloads\bitburner\bitburner-remote-api
npm run watch
# Minimize window, leave running all day

# In Bitburner: Options → Remote API → Connect
```

### Development Loop (10-15 seconds per iteration)
```
1. Edit script in VS Code
2. Save (Ctrl+S) → Auto-sync
3. Test in Bitburner immediately
4. Repeat
```

### Evening Backup (5 minutes, when stable)
```powershell
# Copy stable changes to GitHub repo
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force bitburner-remote-api\src\analysis\* scripts\analysis\

# Push to GitHub
cd scripts
.\Push-ToGitHub.ps1
```

3. **TypeScript Template** - Official tool, simple and reliable
4. **Comprehensive documentation** - Covered all aspects thoroughly
5. **Step-by-step testing** - Verified each component before proceeding

### Important Discoveries
1. **Connection Management** - Must reconnect after stopping npm run watch
2. **Folder Preservation** - Remote API maintains organized structure
3. **Zero Risk Migration** - Original GitHub workflow remains untouched
4. **Instant Sync** - File changes appear in < 2 seconds consistently
5. **Duplicate Cleanup** - Need to remove root-level files after migration

### Best Practices
1. **Keep npm run watch running all day** - Just minimize the window
2. **Backup to GitHub daily** - Or after major changes
3. **Use folder paths in-game** - `run analysis/profit-scan-flex.js`
4. **Clean workspace** - Remove duplicate root-level files
5. **Reconnect after sleep** - Options → Remote API → Connect
