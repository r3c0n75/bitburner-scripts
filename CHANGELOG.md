- ✅ **RAM upgrade detection** - Automatically detects and redeploys on server upgrades
- ✅ **Network RAM tracking** - Shows total network capacity on startup and changes
- ✅ **Smart logging** - Important messages always visible, info respects quiet mode

**Logging Enhancements**:
- All messages go to LOG window (via `ns.print()`)
- Important messages also go to terminal (via `ns.tprint()`)
- Quiet mode suppresses terminal spam while keeping log window updated
- Clean output with proper categorization (info, important, warnings, errors)

**New Output Features**:
```
============================================================
BATCH MANAGER v1.8.8 - Starting...
============================================================
Target: omega-net | Host: home | HackPercent: 5.0%
Interval: 92.24s | Hack Time: 18.45s
Auto-rooting: ENABLED (scan every 10 cycles)
Quiet mode: OFF (terminal + log)
============================================================
Running initial server scan...
Initial scan complete: 64 server(s) rooted (0 new)
Total network RAM: 8676GB across rooted servers
```

**Heartbeat System**:
- Shows activity every cycle for long intervals (>60s)
- Shows activity every 5 cycles for short intervals (<60s)
- Countdown to next scan: "next scan in 7 cycles"
- Clear monitoring status throughout execution

**RAM Upgrade Detection**:
```
✓ Network RAM changed: 8676GB → 10276GB (+1600GB)
Network changes detected - killing existing batcher to redeploy...
✓ Deployed batch/smart-batcher.js on home (pid=1169)
```

**API Call Silencing**:
Disabled logging for 23 API calls to eliminate log spam:
- Network operations: `scan`, `ps`, `kill`, `scp`
- Server info: `getServerMaxRam`, `getServerUsedRam`, `getScriptRam`
- Rooting: `brutessh`, `ftpcrack`, `relaysmtp`, `httpworm`, `sqlinject`, `nuke`
- Access checks: `getServerNumPortsRequired`, `getServerRequiredHackingLevel`, `getHackingLevel`, `hasRootAccess`
- Timing: `getHackTime`, `getGrowTime`, `getWeakenTime`
- Files: `fileExists`, `exec`
- Misc: `sleep`

**Why This Matters**:
- **Visibility**: Always know what the script is doing
- **Debugging**: Easy to track issues via LOG window
- **Automation**: Automatically handles server upgrades
- **Clean logs**: No API call spam, just meaningful updates

**Technical Implementation**:
- Three-tier logging system (info, important, error)
- `info()`: LOG window + optional terminal
- `important()`: Both LOG window and terminal
- `error()`/`warn()`: Both LOG window and terminal
- Network RAM tracking with upgrade detection
- Heartbeat frequency adapts to interval length

## [1.8.7] - 2025-10-28 - Smart Batcher v3.0.0 Compatibility ⚙️✨

### Enhanced Script - Smart Batcher

**Updated Script**:
- `batch/smart-batcher.js` - v3.0.0 game compatibility fix

**Breaking Change Resolved**:
Fixed `formatNumber: Function removed in 3.0.0` error that caused script failure in Bitburner v3.0.0.

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ **Added compatibility helper function** - Works in both v2.8.1 and v3.0.0
- ✅ **Replaced 4 instances** of deprecated `ns.formatNumber()` calls
- ✅ **Three-tier fallback system**: `ns.format.number()` (v3.x) → `ns.formatNumber()` (v2.x) → manual formatting
- ✅ **Zero behavior changes** - Same output, now compatible across game versions

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
function formatNumber(ns, v) {
  // Try new format.number (v3.x) first
  try {
    if (ns.format && ns.format.number) {
      return ns.format.number(v, "$0.00a");
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // Fall through to old method
  }
  
  // Try old formatNumber (v2.x)
  try {
    return ns.formatNumber(v, 2);
  } catch (e) {
    // Manual fallback if both methods fail
    if (v >= 1e9) return `$${(v/1e9).toFixed(2)}b`;
    if (v >= 1e6) return `$${(v/1e6).toFixed(2)}m`;
    if (v >= 1e3) return `$${(v/1e3).toFixed(2)}k`;
    return `$${v.toFixed(2)}`;
  }
}
```

**Affected Output Lines**:
- Money per hack thread display
- Income rate per second
- Income rate per minute
- Income rate per hour

**Testing**:
✅ Confirmed working in Bitburner v3.0.0
✅ Backward compatible with v2.8.1

**Usage** (unchanged):
```bash
run batch/smart-batcher.js joesguns
run batch/smart-batcher.js joesguns 0.05 --quiet
```

**Note**: This follows the same compatibility pattern used in `profit-scan-flex.js` and other v3.0.0-compatible scripts.

## [1.8.6] - 2025-10-28 - Enhanced Global Kill Reliability 🔫✨

### Enhanced Script - Global Kill

**Updated Script**:
- `utils/global-kill.js` - Major reliability enhancement for killing all processes

**Key Improvements**:
- **Uses `ns.killall()` for bulk operations** - More efficient and reliable than individual process kills
- **Strategic delays** - 50ms delay after each server's processes are killed to ensure proper processing
- **Smart execution order** - Processes all remote servers first, saves current host for last
- **Double self-kill protection** - Checks both filename AND process ID to prevent premature termination
- **Better feedback** - Clear ✓ indicator with total processes killed and servers processed

**Why This Matters**:
The original version had timing issues that caused some processes to survive the kill command. The enhanced version:
- Eliminates race conditions with strategic delays
- Prevents self-termination during execution
- Provides 100% reliable process termination across entire network
- Gives clear feedback about what was killed

**Technical Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD: Individual kills with no delays
for (const proc of procs) {
  if (proc.filename !== "global-kill.js") {
    ns.kill(proc.pid);
  }
}

// NEW: Bulk killall with strategic delays
const killed = ns.killall(host);
await ns.sleep(50); // Ensure kills are processed
```

**Usage** (unchanged):
```bash
run utils/global-kill.js
```

**Results**:
- 100% reliable process termination
- No more surviving processes after execution
- Clear status reporting

## [1.8.2] - 2025-10-27 - Stock Momentum Analyzer 4S Data Enhancement 🎯✨

### Enhanced - Forecast Intelligence Integration

**Enhanced Script**:
- `stocks/stock-momentum-analyzer.js` - Added optional 4S Market Data integration for forecast validation

**Key Features**:
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects if you have 4S Market Data ($1 billion)
- **Forecast Alignment Analysis**: Shows whether momentum confirms or contradicts forecast
- **Confidence Scoring**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on momentum + forecast agreement
- **Trap Detection**: Warns when momentum signals are about to reverse (contradicts forecast)
- **Smart Sorting**: Prioritizes high-confidence opportunities in recommendations
- **Backward Compatible**: Works perfectly without 4S Data (momentum-only analysis)

**Enhanced Display (with 4S Data)**:
```
OMTK @ $68.61k | Momentum: 3↑ 1↓ | Change: +0.21%
       📊 Forecast: 65% ↑ | Alignment: ✅ CONFIRMS | Confidence: 🟡 MEDIUM

OMGA @ $2.11k  | Momentum: 4↑ 0↓ | Change: +0.64%
       📊 Forecast: 44% ↓ | Alignment: ⚠️ CONTRADICTS | Confidence: 🔴 LOW
```

**Confidence Scoring System**:
- **🟢 HIGH**: Strong momentum (4+) + Strong forecast (65%+) = Both strongly agree
- **🟡 MEDIUM**: Good momentum (3+) + Good forecast (58%+) = Both agree
- **🔴 LOW**: Momentum contradicts forecast = **TRAP WARNING** (don't buy!)

**Why This Matters**:
- **Prevents Trap Trades**: See when momentum is misleading (stock about to reverse)
- **Validates Signals**: Confirms which momentum signals are backed by real forecast data
- **Improves Success Rate**: Only trade HIGH/MEDIUM confidence opportunities
- **Educational**: Learn how momentum relates to underlying forecast mechanics
- **Source Code Validated**: Game uses real forecasts that drive price changes (randomized timing)

**Real-World Example** (from user testing):
```
Without Enhancement: 8 momentum signals → Would buy all 8 stocks
With Enhancement: 0 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 7 LOW confidence
Result: Prevented 7 trap trades (87.5% failure rate avoided!)
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Works with or without 4S Data (auto-detects)
run stocks/stock-momentum-analyzer.js 5

# Longer analysis for more accuracy
run stocks/stock-momentum-analyzer.js 10
```

**Requirements**:
- TIX API Access ($5 billion) - REQUIRED
- 4S Market Data ($1 billion) - OPTIONAL (but highly recommended for validation)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Calculates forecast alignment (momentum direction vs forecast direction)
- Scores confidence based on strength of both indicators
- Sorts recommendations by confidence level (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
- Provides summary statistics showing confidence distribution
- Gracefully falls back to momentum-only if 4S Data unavailable

**Updated Files**:
- Enhanced: `bitburner-remote-api/src/stocks/stock-momentum-analyzer.js`
- Enhanced: `scripts/stocks/stock-momentum-analyzer.js`
- Updated: `docs/STOCK_TRADING_GUIDE.md` (documented 4S Data integration)
- Updated: `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry)

**Impact**: This enhancement transforms the momentum analyzer from a simple preview tool into an intelligent trading decision system that validates momentum signals against forecast data, dramatically reducing false positive trades.

**Key Features**:
- **No 4S Data Required**: Only needs TIX API! Uses price history tracking instead of forecasts
- **Momentum Strategy**: Buy stocks on rallies (positive momentum), hold until profit target or stop loss
- **Profit Target Parameter**: User-configurable profit target (e.g., 0.03 = 3%, 0.05 = 5%, 0.10 = 10%)
- **Stop Loss Protection**: User-configurable stop loss to limit losses (e.g., 0.05 = 5%, 0.10 = 10%)
- **Flexible Capital Management**: Specify max stocks and total capital investment
- **Commission-Aware**: Accounts for $100k transaction fees in calculations
- **Selective Filtering**: Only trades stable stocks (≤3% price swings)
- **Preview Mode**: Analyze momentum without risking capital

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Conservative: 5 stocks, $1b capital, 5% profit target, 5% stop loss
run stocks/stock-trader-momentum.js 5 1000000000 0.05 0.05 6000

# Moderate: 10 stocks, $2b capital, 10% profit target, 5% stop loss
run stocks/stock-trader-momentum.js 10 2000000000 0.10 0.05 6000

# Aggressive: 3 stocks, $500m capital, 3% profit target, 100% stop loss (no stop loss)
run stocks/stock-trader-momentum.js 3 500000000 0.03 1.0 6000

# Preview momentum before trading
run stocks/stock-momentum-analyzer.js 5
```

**Parameters**:
- `max-stocks`: Maximum number of different stocks to buy (e.g., 5, 10)
- `total-capital`: Total money to invest across ALL stocks (e.g., 1000000000 = $1b)
- `profit-target`: Profit % to auto-sell at (e.g., 0.03 = 3%, 0.05 = 5%, 0.10 = 10%)
- `stop-loss`: Loss % to auto-sell at (e.g., 0.05 = 5%, 0.10 = 10%) - protects capital
- `refresh-rate-ms`: How often to check market (default: 6000 = 6 seconds)

**Strategy (MOMENTUM with RISK MANAGEMENT)**:
- Track price changes over last 5 cycles (30 seconds)
- Buy when 4+ POSITIVE price movements detected (riding the rally)
- Sell ONLY when profit target reached OR stop loss triggered
- Follows upward trends - holds positions until exit conditions met
- Accounts for $100k commission per transaction
- Skip stocks with >3% price swings (too volatile)

**Cost Savings**:
- **Without 4S Data**: Only need TIX API ($5 billion) vs $6 billion for forecast-based
- **Alternative Strategy**: When you can't afford or don't want to buy 4S Market Data
- **Lower Barrier**: Start automated trading earlier in game progression

**Performance**:
- Results vary based on market conditions
- Momentum strategy: Ride rallies, hold for profit target
- Profit targets lock in gains automatically

## [1.5.3] - 2025-10-26 - Fleet Potential Ranking Fix 🔧

### FIXED - profit-scan-flex.js (Fleet Potential Score)

**Fixed critical flaw in `--optimal` mode that ranked low-capacity servers too high!**

**The Problem**:
- Original optimal mode ranked by per-thread income only
- Favored fast cycle/low max money servers (sigma-cosmetics: $57.5m)
- Ignored max money capacity (silver-helix: $1.13 BILLION)
- Result: Recommended targets that saturated quickly with large fleets
- User experience: sigma-cosmetics produced $1.57m/s vs silver-helix's $3.41m/s (2.2x worse!)

**The Solution - Fleet Potential Score**:
```
Fleet Score = Per-thread income × log10(Max Money)
```

This formula:
- ✅ Rewards BOTH per-thread efficiency AND max money capacity
- ✅ Uses logarithmic scale so high-capacity doesn't completely dominate
- ✅ Ranks targets properly for large server fleets
- ✅ Identifies targets that can support 100-2000 threads

**Real-World Results**:
```
OLD Rankings (broken):          NEW Rankings (fixed):
1. sigma-cosmetics  30.73k/s    1. silver-helix     155k score ($1.13b)
   Max: $57.5m                     Max: $1.13b ⭐
   
2. phantasy         21.93k/s    2. omega-net        140k score ($1.59b)
   Max: $600m                      Max: $1.59b ⭐
   
3. silver-helix     17.39k/s    3. the-hub          111k score ($4.55b)
   Max: $1.13b ⭐                  Max: $4.55b ⭐
```

**New Display**:
- Shows Fleet Score prominently
- ⭐ marker emphasizes max money importance
- Explains formula in footer
- Per-thread income still visible but not primary ranking

**Benefits**:
- 🎯 Correctly identifies high-capacity targets for large fleets
- 💰 Maximizes actual production (not theoretical per-thread)
- 📊 Prevents target saturation issues
- 🚀 Ranks silver-helix properly (where it belongs!)

**Updated Files**:
- Fixed: `bitburner-remote-api/src/analysis/profit-scan-flex.js`
- Fixed: `scripts/analysis/profit-scan-flex.js`

## [1.5.2] - 2025-10-26 - Optimal State Profit Scanner 🎯

### ENHANCED - profit-scan-flex.js (Optimal State Rankings)

**Added `--optimal` flag to rank servers by POTENTIAL instead of current degraded state!**

**The Discovery**:
- User targeted `silver-helix` despite it ranking low in current state
- After smart-batcher prep: $34k/s → $3.41m/s (100x improvement!)
- Root cause: Current rankings misleading due to high security degradation
- Solution: New `--optimal` mode shows potential at min security

**New Features**:
1. **Optimal Mode (`--optimal` flag)**:
   - Ranks by POTENTIAL (min security, max money)
   - Calculates optimal timing and hack chance at min security
   - Shows improvement percentage for servers needing prep
   - Example: "Current: $9.70k/s (217% gain possible)"

2. **Prep Status Indicators**:
   - ✓ READY - At/near min security, farm immediately
   - ◐ LIGHT PREP - Needs weakening (Δ security > 50% of min)
   - ⚠ HEAVY PREP - Needs significant prep (Δ security > 200% of min)

3. **Dual-Mode Display**:
   - Current mode (default): Shows as-is state with potential hints
   - Optimal mode (`--optimal`): Rankings by potential with prep requirements
   - Both modes show batch-cycle-aware realistic estimates

4. **Smart Hints**:
   - Current mode shows "💡 Potential after prep" for servers with 2x+ gain
   - Optimal mode shows current vs potential comparison
   - Security delta displayed: "Security: 10.0/3 (Δ7.0)"

**Real-World Example**:

- Enhanced: `scripts/analysis/profit-scan-flex.js`

## [1.5.1] - 2025-10-26 - Batch Manager Smart Upgrade ⚡

### CHANGED - batch-manager.js
**Upgraded to deploy smart-batcher.js instead of simple-batcher.js!**

**Breaking Change**:
- Parameter change: `capPerHost` → `hackPercent`
- Old: `run batch-manager.js joesguns 12 1.25 home --quiet` (capPerHost=12)
- New: `run batch-manager.js joesguns 0.05 1.25 home --quiet` (hackPercent=0.05 = 5%)

**Benefits**:
- 🚀 Automatically deploys 490x more efficient smart-batcher
- 💰 Leverages optimal timing-based thread ratios (4% hack / 87% grow / 9% weaken)
- ⚡ 3-4x faster server preparation
- 📊 Inherits all smart-batcher intelligence (timing analysis, production estimates)

**Intelligent Quiet Mode** 🤫:
- Shows full smart-batcher output on initial deployment
- Then stays silent until new servers are rooted
- Only redeploys when new servers discovered (not every cycle)
- Perfect for long-term automated management

**Migration**:
- Replace second parameter with hack percentage (0.01-1.0, recommended: 0.05)
- Default behavior maintains 5% hack rate when parameter omitted
- All flags (--quiet, --no-root) remain unchanged

**Updated Usage**:
```bash
run batch-manager.js joesguns 0.05 1.25 home --quiet  # 5% hack rate
run batch-manager.js joesguns --quiet                 # Uses default 5% hack
run batch-manager.js --quiet --no-root                # Disable auto-rooting
```

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-26 - Smart Batcher & Production Analysis Revolution 🚀

### NEW - smart-batcher.js (Game-Changing Performance) 🎯

**Revolutionary batch deployment system with timing-based optimal thread ratios!**

**Performance Achievement**:
- 🚀 **490x improvement** over basic batching ($4k/s → $2.09m/s)
- 💰 **$2.09 million/second** sustained production
- 🏦 **$7.5 billion/hour** income rate
- ⚡ **Production-ready in 6-8 minutes** (vs 15-20 minutes with old method)

**Key Innovation - Timing-Based Thread Ratios**:
```
Traditional approach: 25% hack / 45% grow / 30% weaken (inefficient)
Smart approach:        4% hack / 87% grow /  9% weaken (optimal)
```

**How It Works**:
1. Analyzes target server timing (hack/grow/weaken duration)
2. Calculates optimal ratios based on security mechanics
3. Allocates threads proportionally to operation duration
4. Focuses 87% of power on grow for exponential money growth
5. Uses minimal hack threads for maximum efficiency

**Features**:
- 📊 **Intelligent Ratio Calculator**: Based on security impact (0.002/0.004/0.05)
- ⚖️ **Timing Analysis**: Calculates batch window and efficiency
- 💰 **Production Estimates**: Shows expected income after prep
- 🎯 **Customizable**: Adjust hack percentage (default 5%)
- 📈 **Beautiful Output**: Professional formatted deployment summary

**Usage**:
```bash
run batch/smart-batcher.js joesguns              # Deploy with optimal ratios
run batch/smart-batcher.js joesguns 0.10         # Hack 10% per batch
run batch/smart-batcher.js joesguns --dry        # Test without deploying
run batch/smart-batcher.js joesguns --quiet      # Quiet mode
run batch/smart-batcher.js joesguns --include-home  # Include home server
```

**Results (Real Testing)**:
- Deployed across 56 servers
- 1304 total threads (45 hack / 1119 grow / 140 weaken)
- Thread ratios: 3.5% / 85.8% / 10.7% (near-perfect match to target 4.3% / 87.0% / 8.7%)
- Server prepped to 97% in 6 minutes
- Sustained $2.09m/s production achieved

### ENHANCED - estimate-production.js (Realistic Calculations) 📊

**Fixed misleading production estimates with batch-cycle-aware calculations!**

**The Problem**:
- Old calculation: `money / hackTime` (assumes continuous hacking)
- Showed $45.85k/s but actual was only $4.26k/s (10x off!)
- Didn't account for grow/weaken cycle time

**The Solution**:
- New calculation: `money / (max(hackTime, growTime, weakenTime) * 1.25)`
- Shows realistic batch cycle rates
- Accounts for grow/weaken overhead
- Displays batch efficiency (typically 20%)

**New Information Displayed**:
```
=== Batch Cycle Analysis ===
Batch Cycle Time: 22.32s
Safe Interval: 27.90s
Max Batches/min: 2.15

=== Realistic Production Estimates ===
1 hack threads: $9.55k/s (realistic, not $45.85k/s)

=== Efficiency Analysis ===
Theoretical max: $45.85k/s
Realistic rate: $9.55k/s
Batch efficiency: 20.0%

⚠️ WARNING: Server only at 0.5% of max money
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Estimates now match actual measured production
- ✅ Shows server prep status (current money %)
- ✅ Calculates realistic batches per minute
- ✅ Displays timing efficiency breakdown
- ✅ Warns if server needs preparation

### ENHANCED - profit-scan-flex.js (Realistic Rankings) 🎯

**Fixed profit calculations to use realistic batch cycles!**

**Changes**:
- Updated to use same batch-cycle-aware calculation as estimate-production.js
- Ranks servers by realistic income potential (not theoretical continuous hack)
- Income estimates now ~20% of previous (realistic vs idealized)
- Rankings may change but are now accurate for batch operations

**Before**: `foodnstuff: 49.79k/s` (misleading)  
**After**: `foodnstuff: 9.96k/s` (realistic with batch overhead)

**Usage** (unchanged):
```bash
run analysis/profit-scan-flex.js        # Show top targets
run analysis/profit-scan-flex.js 50     # Show top 50
run analysis/profit-scan-flex.js --save # Save timing data
```

### Impact & Recommendations

**Migration Path**:
1. Use `profit-scan-flex.js` to find best target (now shows realistic rates)
2. Use `estimate-production.js` to calculate expected production
3. Deploy with `smart-batcher.js` for optimal performance
4. Monitor with `production-monitor.js` to verify results

**Performance Comparison**:
```
simple-batcher.js:  $4.26k/s  (basic ratio allocation)
smart-batcher.js:   $2.09m/s  (timing-optimized ratios)
Improvement:        490x faster, $7.5B/hour
```

**Why Smart-Batcher Works**:
- Grow operations take 3-4x longer than hack
- Need proportionally more grow threads to maintain balance
- 87% grow allocation enables exponential money growth
- Server reaches max money 3-4x faster
- Maintains perfect security with minimal weaken threads
- Uses only 4% hack threads (all that's needed when server is full)

**Files Modified**:
- Added: `bitburner-remote-api/src/batch/smart-batcher.js`
- Added: `scripts/batch/smart-batcher.js`
- Enhanced: `bitburner-remote-api/src/utils/estimate-production.js`
- Enhanced: `scripts/utils/estimate-production.js`
- Enhanced: `bitburner-remote-api/src/analysis/profit-scan-flex.js`
- Enhanced: `scripts/analysis/profit-scan-flex.js`

## [1.4.4] - 2025-10-26 - Script Organization & Enhanced Error Handling 📁

### Major Changes
- **Removed**: `auto-deploy-all.js` - Outdated script using basic continuous hacking
  - Replaced in all documentation with `auto-expand.js` (superior root-and-deploy)
  - Removed from both `deploy/` folder and `bitburner-update.js` download list
  
- **Reorganized**: `home-batcher.js` moved from `deploy/` → `batch/`
  - Now properly grouped with other batch scripts (`simple-batcher.js`, `batch-manager.js`)
  - Updated all 9+ documentation files to reflect new location
  - New usage: `run batch/home-batcher.js [target]`

### Enhanced - home-batcher.js (Major Rewrite) 🚀

**Critical Bug Fixed**:
- Original version would silently fail to start hack script if RAM ran out
- Only weaken/grow would run, no money actually hacked
- No error messages shown to user

**New Features**:
1. **Conflict Detection** ⚠️
   - Warns about other scripts competing for RAM (e.g., batch-manager.js)
   - Shows which scripts are running and their thread counts
   
2. **Detailed RAM Analysis** 📊
   - Shows available vs needed RAM with precise calculations
   - Displays thread allocation breakdown (h/g/w)
   - Pre-validates RAM before attempting to start scripts
   
3. **Explicit Failure Reporting** 🚨
   - Checks RAM availability before EACH script execution
   - Reports exactly which scripts failed and why
   - Shows needed vs available RAM for failed scripts
   
4. **Smart Summary** ✅
   - Clear success/failure counts
   - Helpful recommendations if partial failure occurs
   - Professional formatted output with visual indicators

**Example Output**:
```
⚠ WARNING: 1 other script(s) running on home:
  - batch/batch-manager.js (1 threads)
  This may cause RAM conflicts!

Available RAM: 502.10GB / 512.00GB
Needed RAM: 496.95GB

✓ Started core/attack-weaken.js with 87 threads
✓ Started core/attack-grow.js with 128 threads
✓ Started core/attack-hack.js with 71 threads

✓ SUCCESS: All 3 helper scripts started!
```

### Documentation Updates
- Updated all references to `auto-deploy-all.js` → `auto-expand.js`
- Updated all references to `deploy/home-batcher.js` → `batch/home-batcher.js`
- Files updated: bitburner-update.js, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md,
  SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, DETAILED_CHANGES.md, 
  ERROR_HANDLING_IMPROVEMENTS.md, NEW_GAME_QUICKSTART.md, replace-pservs-no-copy.js

### Impact

## [1.4.3] - 2025-10-26 - Intelligent Quiet Mode Logging 🔔

### Added
- **batch-manager.js Enhanced Logging** - Important events now always visible in quiet mode
  - New three-tier logging system: `info()`, `important()`, `error()`/`warn()`
  - Rooting notifications bypass quiet flag: "✓ Rooted: {server} (Level {X}, {Y} ports)"
  - Summary messages always display: "Rooting scan complete: {N} new server(s) rooted"
  - Regular operational messages still respect `--quiet` flag

### Technical Details
- **Enhancement**: Created `important()` logging function that always uses `ns.tprint()`
- **Rationale**: Server rooting is critical game progression information that shouldn't be hidden
- **Implementation**: Lines 60, 128, and 137 in batch-manager.js
- **Behavior**: 
  - With `--quiet`: Rooting notifications visible, routine status hidden
  - Without `--quiet`: All messages visible as normal
  - Errors/warnings: Always visible in both modes

### Impact
✅ Never miss important rooting notifications in quiet mode  
✅ Maintain clean output with --quiet for routine operations  
✅ Better user experience with intelligent message prioritization

## [1.4.2] - 2025-10-26 - Batch Manager Path Fix 🔧

### Fixed
- **batch-manager.js Script Path Reference** - Fixed incorrect path to simple-batcher.js
  - Changed from `"simple-batcher.js"` to `"batch/simple-batcher.js"`
  - Resolves "scp failed" error when batch-manager attempts to copy batcher script
  - Updated in all locations: scripts/, bitburner-remote-api/src/, bitburner-remote-api/dist/

### Technical Details
- **Issue**: batch-manager.js was looking for simple-batcher.js in root directory instead of batch/ subdirectory
- **Root Cause**: Script reference didn't account for organized folder structure
- **Solution**: Updated batcher constant to include full path: `batch/simple-batcher.js`
- **Result**: batch-manager.js can now successfully locate and copy simple-batcher.js to target servers

### Impact
✅ Batch manager now works correctly with folder-organized structure  
✅ Eliminates "scp failed" errors during batch system initialization  
✅ Maintains consistency with Remote API folder organization

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-26 - Profit Scanner Default Behavior Improvement

### Changed
- **profit-scan-flex.js** - Changed default behavior for better UX
  - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Now filters out zero-money servers BY DEFAULT
  - Added `--all` flag to show ALL servers (including purchased servers, home, darkweb)
  - Removed `--only-money` flag (now the default behavior)
  - Default output now shows only profitable targets without requiring a flag
  - Most users want to see only hackable targets, not purchased servers
  - Significantly improved user experience with cleaner default output

### Technical Details
```javascript
// Lines 34-36: New flag logic
const showAll = flags.has("--all");
// Default behavior: filter out zero-money servers (unless --all is specified)
const onlyMoney = !showAll;
```

### Migration Notes
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Default behavior has changed
- **Before**: `run profit-scan-flex.js` showed ALL servers (including purchased servers)
- **After**: `run profit-scan-flex.js` shows ONLY money servers (cleaner output)
- **To see all servers**: Use `run profit-scan-flex.js --all`
- **Removed flag**: `--only-money` no longer needed (now default behavior)
- Existing cache files will continue to work

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-26 - Profit Scanner Filter Enhancement

### Fixed
- **profit-scan-flex.js** - Enhanced `--only-money` flag functionality
  - Previously only filtered during override file generation
  - Now filters both during generation AND display output
  - Properly hides purchased servers, home, darkweb, and other zero-money servers
  - Shows only hackable targets (rooted with money) and future targets (not rooted but have money)
  - Improves output clarity by removing clutter from zero-value servers
  - Bug fix: Lines 137-138 added display-time filtering that respects `--only-money` flag

### Technical Details
```javascript
// Added at line 137-138 in display logic
if (onlyMoney && (!maxMoney || maxMoney <= 0)) continue;
```

### Migration Notes
- No breaking changes
- Existing profiler-overrides.json files generated with `--only-money` will work correctly
- Users can regenerate cache with `rm profiler-overrides.json` then run with `--only-money` flag
- All existing flags and parameters remain unchanged

#### Error Handling & Logging Improvements

##### 1. Structured Logging System
- **Multi-level logging** (info, warn, error) in all scripts
- **Quiet mode support** for automated operations
- **Consistent formatting** across all log messages
- **Context-aware logging** with script names and operations

##### 2. Try-Catch Error Handling
- **Comprehensive error wrapping** for all critical operations
- **Graceful failure recovery** - scripts continue on individual errors
- **Error context preservation** - shows what operation failed
- **Nested error handling** - independent operation protection

##### 3. Validation and Early Returns
- **Pre-execution validation** for all prerequisites
- **Early return patterns** prevent downstream errors
- **Parameter validation** with usage messages
- **Resource validation** (RAM, scripts, access) before operations

##### 4. Detailed Error Messages
- **Specific error descriptions** instead of generic messages
- **Diagnostic information** included in error output
- **Formatted values** (RAM, money) for readability
- **Actionable suggestions** for error resolution

##### 5. Success/Failure Tracking
- **Operation counters** in deployment scripts
- **Final summaries** showing success/failure counts
- **Per-operation status** reporting
- **Overall completion status** for monitoring

##### 6. RAM Validation Enhancements
- **Multiple validation conditions** (NaN, zero, negative)
- **Formatted comparisons** (available vs required)
- **Clear error messages** with specific values
- **Safety checks** before thread calculations

##### 7. Enhanced User Feedback
- **Progress indicators** during long operations
- **Status updates** for each server/operation
- **Summary reports** at completion
- **Cost/benefit information** before operations

#### Changed

##### File Organization
- **Moved all scripts** from root to organized directories
- **Cleaned up root directory** - removed duplicate/old scripts
- **Created logical categories** for easier navigation
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with script names

##### Script Improvements
- **All scripts** now have consistent headers with usage examples
- **Enhanced documentation** in script comments
- **Standardized parameter handling** across all scripts
- **Improved output formatting** with ns.nFormat

##### Documentation Updates
- **Comprehensive README** with all features documented
- **Getting started guide** with game stage progression
- **Complete script reference** with examples
- **Error handling documentation** with before/after comparisons

#### Removed

##### Cleanup
- **Deleted duplicate scripts** from root directory after reorganization:
  - attack-hack.js, attack-grow.js, attack-weaken.js (moved to core/)
  - batch-manager.js, simple-batcher.js (moved to batch/)
  - profit-scan.js, production-monitor.js (moved to analysis/)
  - global-kill.js, list-procs.js, list-pservs.js (moved to utils/)
  - auto-deploy-all.js, purchase-server-8gb.js, etc. (moved to deploy/)
- **Removed obsolete scripts**:
  - early-hack-template.js (replaced by organized deployment scripts)
  - pserv-0_batch-manager.js (functionality integrated into batch-manager.js)
  - profiler-overrides.json (not needed for this collection)

### Technical Details

#### Logging System Architecture
```javascript
// Three-level logging with quiet mode support
const info = (...parts) => ns.print(parts.join(" "));           // Quiet-aware
const warn = (...parts) => ns.tprint("[WARN] " + parts.join(" ")); // Always visible
const error = (...parts) => ns.tprint("[ERR] " + parts.join(" "));  // Always visible
```

#### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
try {
  // Critical operation
  const result = performOperation();
  if (!result) {
    error(`Operation failed: specific reason`);
    failureCounter++;
    continue;
  }
  successCounter++;
} catch (e) {
  error(`Exception during operation: ${e}`);
  failureCounter++;
}
```

#### Validation Pattern
```javascript
// Early validation with informative messages
if (!prerequisiteCheck()) {
  ns.tprint("ERROR: Prerequisite not met. Do this to fix it.");
  return;
}

// Resource validation with formatted output
if (available < required) {
  ns.tprint(`Insufficient resources: ${available.toFixed(2)} < ${required.toFixed(2)}`);
  return;
}
```

### Migration Notes

#### For Existing Users
1. **Backup your current scripts** before updating
2. **Copy scripts from organized directories** to your game home directory
3. **Update any custom scripts** that reference the old script names
4. **Test batch operations** in dry-run mode first (`--dry` flag)

#### Script Path Changes
All scripts have moved to subdirectories but can still be run from home:
```bash
# Old: run attack-hack.js target
# New: run attack-hack.js target  (still works if copied to home)
```

#### Breaking Changes
None - all script names and interfaces remain the same.

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced log spam** with quiet mode support
- **Better error recovery** prevents script restarts
- **Efficient validation** prevents wasted operations
- **Smart retry logic** in batch manager

### Known Issues
None identified in this release.

### Future Enhancements
- Additional target presets for specific servers
- Advanced batch timing optimization
- Integration with game statistics API
- Automated target selection based on current stats
- Multi-target batch operations
- Performance metrics dashboard
