## Prerequisites

### Required Purchases (From WSE - World Stock Exchange)

1. **WSE Account** (Free)
   - Visit World Stock Exchange in the City
   - Create account to view stock prices

2. **TIX API Access** ($5 billion)
   - Required for ALL automated trading scripts
   - Allows programmatic buying/selling
   - One-time purchase, permanent across resets

3. **4S Market Data TIX API** ($1 billion)
   - **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** for profitable trading
   - Provides stock forecasts (bullish/bearish predictions)
   - Essential for basic and advanced traders
   - Without this, you're trading blind!

### Cost Summary
- **Minimum (Forecast-Based)**: $6 billion (TIX API + 4S Data)
- **Minimum (Momentum-Based)**: $5 billion (TIX API only - no 4S Data needed!)

**Note**: Some Bitburner versions include short position functionality (betting against stocks), but this is not universally available. All scripts work with long positions only.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Commission Impact Guide

### Understanding Stock Trading Commissions

**EVERY stock trade costs $100,000 commission!**

- **Buying stocks**: $100,000 commission
- **Selling stocks**: $100,000 commission
- **Total per round trip**: **$200,000**

This commission is **FIXED** regardless of position size, which means:
- Small positions get destroyed by commissions
- Large positions barely notice them

### The Math That Matters

**Example 1: Small Position (BANKRUPTCY)**
```
Position: $200,000 (10 stocks × $200k each from $2m total)
Stock gains 15%: Worth $230,000
Sell proceeds after commission: $230,000 - $100,000 = $130,000
Original cost: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

NET LOSS: -$170,000 (-85% return!) ❌
```

**Example 2: Medium Position (STILL LOSING)**
```
Position: $1,000,000
Stock gains 15%: Worth $1,150,000
Sell proceeds after commission: $1,150,000 - $100,000 = $1,050,000
Original cost: $1,000,000 + $100,000 = $1,100,000

NET LOSS: -$50,000 (-4.5% return) ❌
```

**Example 3: Large Position (PROFITABLE)**
```
Position: $5,000,000
Stock gains 15%: Worth $5,750,000
Sell proceeds after commission: $5,750,000 - $100,000 = $5,650,000
Original cost: $5,000,000 + $100,000 = $5,100,000

NET PROFIT: +$550,000 (+10.8% return) ✓
```

### Minimum Capital Requirements by Script

| Script | Min Position Size | Min Total Capital | Recommended |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **stock-trader-basic.js** | $1,000,000 per stock | $10,000,000 for 10 stocks | $50m+ |
| **stock-trader-advanced.js** | $2,000,000 per stock | $20,000,000 for 10 stocks | $100m+ |
| **stock-trader-momentum.js** | $1,000,000 per stock | $5,000,000 for 5 stocks | $10m+ |

### Position Size Calculator

**Formula**: Commission Impact % = ($200,000 / Position Size) × 100

| Position Size | Commission % | Status | Viability |
|--------------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| $200,000 | 100% | 💀 **FATAL** | Will lose everything to commissions |
| $500,000 | 40% | ❌ **TERRIBLE** | Need 40%+ gain just to break even |
| $1,000,000 | 20% | ⚠️ **MARGINAL** | Need 20%+ gain to profit (possible) |
| $2,000,000 | 10% | ⚙️ **WORKABLE** | Need 10%+ gain to profit (achievable) |
| $5,000,000 | 4% | ✅ **GOOD** | Only 4% overhead, normal targets work |
| $10,000,000+ | 2% | ⭐ **IDEAL** | Commission negligible, full profitability |

### Safe Capital Guidelines

**DO NOT trade stocks if you have less than:**
- **$10 million** for basic trading
- **$20 million** for advanced trading
- **$5 million** for momentum trading (can use fewer stocks)

**If you have limited capital, adjust stock count:**
```bash
# $5m capital → 5 stocks maximum
run stocks/stock-trader-basic.js 5 5000000

# $3m capital → 3 stocks maximum
run stocks/stock-trader-basic.js 3 3000000

# $10m capital → 10 stocks (optimal)
run stocks/stock-trader-basic.js 10 10000000
```

### Why Small Capital Fails

With $2 million across 10 stocks:
1. Each position = $200k
2. Commission = $200k per round trip
3. **Break-even requires 100% price gain** (impossible)
4. Every trade is automatically a loss
5. More trading = faster bankruptcy

**Real example from testing:**
- Started with $2m
- Made 188 trades in minutes
- Ended with $120k remaining
- Lost $1.88m to commissions (-94% total loss)

### How to Build Capital for Stock Trading

If you don't have enough capital yet, use these strategies:

```bash
# Smart batching - Build capital fast
run batch/batch-manager.js [target] 0.05 1.25 home --quiet

# Automated expansion
run deploy/auto-expand.js
```

Get to $50+ billion, THEN stocks become highly profitable!

### Commission-Aware Trading

The **advanced trader** now calculates profit targets **AFTER commissions**:
```bash
# 25% NET profit target (accounts for $200k fees)
run stocks/stock-trader-advanced.js 10 50000000 0.25 0.15 6000
```

With the fixed commission bug, positions sell when they **actually** reach the target profit after fees, not before!

### Key Takeaways

✅ **DO**:
- Wait until you have $10m+ before trading stocks
- Use fewer stocks if you have limited capital
- Calculate break-even points including commissions
- Focus on larger positions ($1m+ each)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Trade with less than $5m total capital
- Spread thin across many small positions
- Expect profits from $200k-500k positions
- Ignore commission impact calculations

```

### Market Mechanics

**Forecast Interpretation**:
- **>55%**: Bullish - price likely to rise (BUY)
- **45-55%**: Neutral - uncertain direction (HOLD/AVOID)
- **<45%**: Bearish - price likely to fall (SHORT or AVOID)

**Best Forecast Ranges**:
- **>60%**: Strong buy signal
- **<40%**: Strong short signal
- **50%**: Completely random - avoid!

**Market Updates**:
- Stock prices update every ~6 seconds
- Forecasts change based on many factors
- Volatility affects price swings

## Performance Tips

### Maximize Profits

1. **Capital Allocation**
   - Don't put all money in one stock
   - Diversify across 5-10 positions
   - Keep some cash for opportunities

2. **Timing**
   - Market updates every 6 seconds
   - Set refresh rate to 6000ms (6 seconds)
   - Faster checks waste CPU with no benefit

3. **Forecast Quality**
   - Focus on >60% or <40% forecasts
   - Avoid 50% (neutral) stocks
   - Higher volatility = bigger swings

4. **Commission Management**
   - Each trade costs $100k commission
   - Avoid frequent small trades
   - Bigger positions reduce commission impact

### Optimization Checklist

✓ **Have 4S Market Data** - Can't trade profitably without forecasts  
✓ **Use 6-second refresh** - Matches market update frequency  
✓ **Diversify positions** - Don't bet everything on one stock  
✓ **Monitor regularly** - Check for stuck positions or problems  
✓ **Scale with capital** - Bigger budget = bigger positions  
✓ **Use dynamic sizing** - Let advanced trader scale positions by confidence  

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Trading without 4S Data (blind trading)  
❌ Refreshing faster than 6 seconds (waste)  
❌ All-in on one stock (high risk)  
❌ Ignoring stop-losses (unlimited losses)  
❌ Too many small positions (commission eats profits)  
❌ Panic selling winners (let trends run)

\* Advanced trader returns depend on whether short positions are available in your game version. Returns shown are for long-only trading.

## Troubleshooting

### "ERROR: You need TIX API Access"
**Solution**: Purchase TIX API from WSE for $5 billion

### "ERROR: You need 4S Market Data TIX API"
**Solution**: Purchase 4S Data from WSE for $1 billion  
**Note**: Essential for profitable trading - don't skip this!

### "Short positions disabled" or "not available in this version"
**Explanation**: Short positions are not available in all Bitburner versions. All trading scripts work correctly with long positions only. The advanced trader will automatically detect and work without shorts if unavailable.

### Scripts not buying anything
**Possible Causes**:
1. No stocks with >55% forecast (bad market)
2. Insufficient funds (need money for trades + $100k commission)
3. Already at max shares for all good stocks
4. Market in neutral phase (all forecasts ~50%)

**Solution**: 
- Check `stock-info.js` for market conditions
- Ensure you have available cash
- Wait for better market conditions

### Losing money consistently
**Possible Causes**:
1. Trading without 4S Data (random trades)
2. Thresholds too aggressive (buying/selling too early)
3. Market in volatile neutral phase
4. Commissions eating small profits

**Solution**:
- **GET 4S DATA** - This is critical!
- Increase position sizes to offset commissions
- Use stricter thresholds (>60% buy, <40% short)
- Stop and wait for clearer market signals

### Script lag or timeouts
**Cause**: Running too many scripts or refresh too fast

**Solution**:
- Run only one trader at a time
- Use 6-second refresh (default)
- Kill unnecessary scripts with `global-kill.js`

## Integration with Other Scripts

### Running with Batch Systems

Stock trading runs independently and works great alongside:
- `smart-batcher.js` - Hacking income
- `batch-manager.js` - Server management
- `auto-expand.js` - Network growth

They don't conflict and diversify your income streams!

### Performance Impact

- **RAM**: ~4-5GB for trader scripts
- **CPU**: Minimal (updates every 6 seconds)
- **Conflict**: None with hacking scripts

## Expected Returns

### Conservative Estimates (Basic Trader)

| Capital | Daily Profit | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| $10b | $2-5b | 20-50% daily |
| $50b | $10-25b | Slower % but bigger $ |
| $100b | $20-50b | Market cap limits kick in |

### Aggressive Estimates (Advanced Trader)

| Capital | Daily Profit | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| $50b | $15-40b | 30-80% with dynamic sizing |
| $100b | $30-80b | Max diversification |
| $200b | $60-160b | Market domination |

**Reality Check**: 
- Results vary by market conditions
- Bad markets may break even or lose
- Commission impact decreases with scale
- Requires 4S Data for these returns!

## Next Steps

1. **Start Small**: Use basic trader with $1-2 billion per stock
2. **Learn Patterns**: Run monitor alongside to understand forecasts
3. **Scale Up**: Increase investment as you gain confidence
4. **Consider Advanced**: Use dynamic sizing when you have $50+ billion capital
5. **Automate**: Let it run while you focus on other gameplay
