## üîì Port Opening Programs (CRITICAL - Buy These First)

### BruteSSH.exe - $500k
**What It Does:** Opens SSH ports (port 1 of 5).

**Used By Scripts:** 
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** üî¥ **CRITICAL - Buy first. Essential for automation.**

Scripts use `ns.brutessh(host)` extensively. Without this, automation cannot root most servers. This is the #1 priority purchase.

---

### FTPCrack.exe - $1.5m
**What It Does:** Opens FTP ports (port 2 of 5).

**Used By Scripts:**
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** üî¥ **CRITICAL - Buy second. Essential for automation.**

Opens the second port needed for many servers. Critical for scripts' `ns.ftpcrack(host)` calls. Buy this immediately after BruteSSH.exe.

---

### relaySMTP.exe - $5m
**What It Does:** Opens SMTP ports (port 3 of 5).

**Used By Scripts:**
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** üî¥ **CRITICAL - Buy early. Essential for automation.**

Unlocks mid-tier servers. Scripts call `ns.relaysmtp(host)`. Third priority purchase for expanding server access.

---

### HTTPWorm.exe - $30m
**What It Does:** Opens HTTP ports (port 4 of 5).

**Used By Scripts:**
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** üî¥ **CRITICAL - Buy mid-game. Essential for automation.**

Required for high-tier servers. Scripts call `ns.httpworm(host)`. Buy when you can afford it to unlock better targets.

---

### SQLInject.exe - $250m
**What It Does:** Opens SQL ports (port 5 of 5).

**Used By Scripts:**
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** üî¥ **CRITICAL - Buy mid-game. Essential for automation.**

Opens the final port. Required for top-tier servers. Scripts call `ns.sqlinject(host)`. Complete your port-opening arsenal with this.

---

## üîç Information Programs

### ServerProfiler.exe - $500k
**What It Does:** Enhances the terminal `scan` command to show detailed server information (required hacking level, RAM, security, ports needed, etc.).

**Used By Scripts:** **NOT USED**

Scripts use `ns.scan()` only for network traversal (getting neighbor lists). All server details are obtained through direct API calls:
- `ns.getServerRequiredHackingLevel()`
- `ns.getServerMaxMoney()`
- `ns.getServerMinSecurityLevel()`
- `ns.getServerMaxRam()`
- `ns.getServerNumPortsRequired()`

**Script Alternative:** All existing scripts already have better access to this data through direct API calls.

**Verdict:** ‚ùå **NEVER BUY - Scripts don't benefit from this.**

This program is useful for **manual terminal exploration** only. Automated scripts don't need it because they query server data directly via API calls that work without ServerProfiler.exe.

**Save your $500k** for essential programs instead. This is the only program in the game with zero automation value.

---

## üî≠ Network Scanning Programs

### DeepscanV1.exe - $500k
**What It Does:** Enables `scan-analyze` terminal command with depth up to 5 levels.

**Used By Scripts:** **NOT USED**

Scripts use BFS (breadth-first search) algorithms to discover the entire network:
- `global-kill.js` - Network traversal for process killing
- `profit-scan-flex.js` - Network scanning for profit analysis
- `auto-expand.js` - Network exploration for deployment

**Script Alternative:** BFS algorithms discover 100% of the network without depth limits.

**Verdict:** üü° **OPTIONAL - Quality of life for manual exploration.**

This is useful when you want to manually explore the network from the terminal. Scripts don't use it, but it's handy for quick manual checks. Buy if you value convenience, skip if you're focused purely on automation.

---

### DeepscanV2.exe - $25m
**What It Does:** Enables `scan-analyze` terminal command with depth up to 10 levels.

**Used By Scripts:** **NOT USED**

Same situation as DeepscanV1 - scripts use unlimited-depth BFS algorithms.

**Verdict:** üü° **OPTIONAL - Quality of life for manual exploration.**

Extends manual scanning to 10 levels deep. Scripts don't use it, but convenient for terminal use. Only buy after all critical programs are purchased.

---

### AutoLink.exe - $1m
**What It Does:** Enables automatic connection via `scan-analyze` command with `--route` flag or number shortcuts.

**Used By Scripts:** **NOT USED**

Scripts connect to servers programmatically using `ns.scp()` and `ns.exec()`.

**Verdict:** üü° **OPTIONAL - Quality of life for manual navigation.**

This is purely for manual convenience. When you use `scan-analyze`, you can click a number to auto-connect. Scripts don't need this, but handy for quick manual server access.

---

## üßÆ Formulas API

### Formulas.exe - $5b
**What It Does:** Unlocks access to the `ns.formulas` API for **perfect accuracy** in calculations (hacking, growth, experience, reputation, etc.).

**Used By Scripts:** **YES - 2 Enhanced Scripts**

#### Scripts That Use Formulas.exe:

**1. f-profit-scan-flex.js** (Enhanced profit scanner)
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.hackTime()` - Exact timing calculations
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.growTime()` - Exact grow timing
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.weakenTime()` - Exact weaken timing  
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.hackPercent()` - Exact money per thread
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.hackChance()` - Exact success probability

**2. f-estimate-production.js** (Enhanced production estimator)
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.*` for all calculations
- Provides perfect accuracy vs estimated values

#### Comparison: Regular vs Formulas Scripts

| Feature | Regular Scripts | Formulas Scripts |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Timing Calculations | `ns.getHackTime()` (estimates) | `ns.formulas.hacking.hackTime()` (exact) |
| Money Calculations | Approximations | Perfect accuracy |
| Success Rates | Estimates | Exact percentages |
| Requirements | $0 (built-in API) | $5 billion (Formulas.exe) |
| Accuracy | ~95-98% accurate | 100% accurate |

#### How Your Scripts Handle Missing Formulas.exe:

Both formulas-enhanced scripts check for availability:

```javascript
if (!ns.formulas || !ns.formulas.hacking) {
  ns.tprint("ERROR: This script requires Formulas.exe ($5 billion)");
  ns.tprint("Purchase from 'buy Formulas.exe' or use regular version");
  return;
}
```

If you don't have Formulas.exe, they exit gracefully and tell you to use the regular versions:
- Use `profit-scan-flex.js` instead of `f-profit-scan-flex.js`
- Use `estimate-production.js` instead of `f-estimate-production.js`

#### Should You Buy Formulas.exe?

**Key Considerations:**
- ‚úÖ Working scripts exist that don't require it
- ‚úÖ Regular scripts are ~95-98% accurate
- ‚úÖ Profit scanning and batching work fine without it
- ‚ùå $5 billion is expensive early game
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Formulas scripts exist but aren't critical

**When to Buy:**
1. **Early Game (< $10b net worth):** ‚ùå **Don't buy yet**
   - Regular scripts work fine
   - Money better spent on critical programs
   
2. **Mid Game ($10b - $100b net worth):** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional**
   - If you want perfect accuracy for optimization
   - If you're fine-tuning complex batch systems
   
3. **Late Game (> $100b net worth):** ‚úÖ **Worth buying**
   - $5b becomes affordable
   - Perfect accuracy helps with advanced optimization
   - Nice to have for precise calculations

**Verdict:** üü¢ **BUY LATE-GAME - Enhances existing scripts but not critical.**

Regular scripts are excellent. The formulas versions provide **marginal improvements** (2-5% accuracy gain). Buy when $5 billion feels affordable, not when it's a major expense.

## üöÄ Bottom Line

**Focus on the five critical port-opening programs first.** Without them, automation cannot root servers. This $287 million investment is mandatory for effective scripting.

**Skip ServerProfiler.exe entirely.** It's the only program in the game that provides zero value to automation. Save that $500k for something useful.

**Optional programs improve convenience but not automation.** Buy DeepscanV1/V2 and AutoLink only if you value quality of life for manual terminal work.

**Formulas.exe is a late-game luxury.** It enhances accuracy in 2 scripts from "excellent" (95-98%) to "perfect" (100%), but regular scripts work great. Buy when $5 billion feels affordable, not when you're building wealth.

**The script library is production-ready with just the five critical programs.** Focus on making money with automation, then buy enhancements later.
