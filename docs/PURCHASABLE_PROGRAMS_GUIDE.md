## üîì Port Opening Programs (All OWNED ‚úÖ)

### BruteSSH.exe - $500k ‚úÖ OWNED
**What It Does:** Opens SSH ports (port 1 of 5).

**Used By Your Scripts:** 
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **CRITICAL - Essential for automation. You already own it.**

Your scripts use `ns.brutessh(host)` extensively. Without this, your automation cannot root most servers.

---

### FTPCrack.exe - $1.5m ‚úÖ OWNED
**What It Does:** Opens FTP ports (port 2 of 5).

**Used By Your Scripts:**
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **CRITICAL - Essential for automation. You already own it.**

Opens the second port needed for many servers. Critical for your scripts' `ns.ftpcrack(host)` calls.

---

### relaySMTP.exe - $5m ‚úÖ OWNED
**What It Does:** Opens SMTP ports (port 3 of 5).

**Used By Your Scripts:**
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **CRITICAL - Essential for automation. You already own it.**

Unlocks mid-tier servers. Your scripts call `ns.relaysmtp(host)`.

---

### HTTPWorm.exe - $30m ‚úÖ OWNED
**What It Does:** Opens HTTP ports (port 4 of 5).

**Used By Your Scripts:**
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **CRITICAL - Essential for automation. You already own it.**

Required for high-tier servers. Your scripts call `ns.httpworm(host)`.

---

### SQLInject.exe - $250m ‚úÖ OWNED
**What It Does:** Opens SQL ports (port 5 of 5).

**Used By Your Scripts:**
- `auto-expand.js` - Automatic server rooting
- `batch-manager.js` - Auto-rooting for batch operations
- All deployment scripts

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **CRITICAL - Essential for automation. You already own it.**

Opens the final port. Required for top-tier servers. Your scripts call `ns.sqlinject(host)`.

---

## üîç Information Programs

### ServerProfiler.exe - $500k ‚ùå Not Owned
**What It Does:** Enhances the terminal `scan` command to show detailed server information (required hacking level, RAM, security, ports needed, etc.).

**Used By Your Scripts:** **NOT USED**

Your scripts use `ns.scan()` only for network traversal (getting neighbor lists). All server details are obtained through direct API calls:
- `ns.getServerRequiredHackingLevel()`
- `ns.getServerMaxMoney()`
- `ns.getServerMinSecurityLevel()`
- `ns.getServerMaxRam()`
- `ns.getServerNumPortsRequired()`

**Script Alternative:** All your existing scripts already have better access to this data.

**Verdict:** ‚ùå **SKIP - Your scripts don't benefit from this.**

This program is useful for **manual terminal exploration** only. Your automated scripts don't need it because they query server data directly via API calls that work without ServerProfiler.exe.

**Save your $500k** for something else.

---

## üî≠ Network Scanning Programs

### DeepscanV1.exe - $500k ‚úÖ OWNED
**What It Does:** Enables `scan-analyze` terminal command with depth up to 5 levels.

**Used By Your Scripts:** **NOT USED**

Your scripts use BFS (breadth-first search) algorithms to discover the entire network:
- `global-kill.js` - Network traversal for process killing
- `profit-scan-flex.js` - Network scanning for profit analysis
- `auto-expand.js` - Network exploration for deployment

**Script Alternative:** Your BFS algorithms discover 100% of the network without depth limits.

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **NICE TO HAVE - Quality of life for manual exploration.**

This is useful when you want to manually explore the network from the terminal. Your scripts don't use it, but it's handy for quick manual checks. You already own it, so it's a convenience feature.

---

### DeepscanV2.exe - $25m ‚úÖ OWNED
**What It Does:** Enables `scan-analyze` terminal command with depth up to 10 levels.

**Used By Your Scripts:** **NOT USED**

Same situation as DeepscanV1 - your scripts use unlimited-depth BFS algorithms.

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **NICE TO HAVE - Quality of life for manual exploration.**

Extends manual scanning to 10 levels deep. Your scripts don't use it, but you already own it. Convenient for terminal use.

---

### AutoLink.exe - $1m ‚úÖ OWNED
**What It Does:** Enables automatic connection via `scan-analyze` command with `--route` flag or number shortcuts.

**Used By Your Scripts:** **NOT USED**

Your scripts connect to servers programmatically using `ns.scp()` and `ns.exec()`.

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **NICE TO HAVE - Quality of life for manual navigation.**

This is purely for manual convenience. When you use `scan-analyze`, you can click a number to auto-connect. Your scripts don't need this, but you already own it. Handy for quick manual server access.

## üßÆ Formulas API

### Formulas.exe - $5b ‚ùå Not Owned
**What It Does:** Unlocks access to the `ns.formulas` API for **perfect accuracy** in calculations (hacking, growth, experience, reputation, etc.).

**Used By Your Scripts:** **YES - 2 Enhanced Scripts**

#### Scripts That Use Formulas.exe:

**1. f-profit-scan-flex.js** (Enhanced profit scanner)
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.hackTime()` - Exact timing calculations
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.growTime()` - Exact grow timing
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.weakenTime()` - Exact weaken timing  
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.hackPercent()` - Exact money per thread
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.hackChance()` - Exact success probability

**2. f-estimate-production.js** (Enhanced production estimator)
- Uses `ns.formulas.hacking.*` for all calculations
- Provides perfect accuracy vs estimated values

#### Comparison: Regular vs Formulas Scripts

| Feature | Regular Scripts | Formulas Scripts |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Timing Calculations | `ns.getHackTime()` (estimates) | `ns.formulas.hacking.hackTime()` (exact) |
| Money Calculations | Approximations | Perfect accuracy |
| Success Rates | Estimates | Exact percentages |
| Requirements | $0 (built-in API) | $5 billion (Formulas.exe) |
| Accuracy | ~95-98% accurate | 100% accurate |

#### How Your Scripts Handle Missing Formulas.exe:

Both formulas-enhanced scripts check for availability:

```javascript
if (!ns.formulas || !ns.formulas.hacking) {
  ns.tprint("ERROR: This script requires Formulas.exe ($5 billion)");
  ns.tprint("Purchase from 'buy Formulas.exe' or use regular version");
  return;
}
```

If you don't have Formulas.exe, they exit gracefully and tell you to use the regular versions:
- Use `profit-scan-flex.js` instead of `f-profit-scan-flex.js`
- Use `estimate-production.js` instead of `f-estimate-production.js`

#### Should You Buy Formulas.exe?

**Current Situation:**
- ‚úÖ You have working scripts that don't require it
- ‚úÖ Regular scripts are ~95-98% accurate
- ‚úÖ Your profit scanning and batching work fine
- ‚ùå $5 billion is expensive early game
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Formulas scripts exist but aren't critical

**When to Buy:**
1. **Early Game (< $10b net worth):** ‚ùå **Don't buy yet**
   - Regular scripts work fine
   - Money better spent on other investments
   
2. **Mid Game ($10b - $100b net worth):** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional**
   - If you want perfect accuracy for optimization
   - If you're fine-tuning complex batch systems
   
3. **Late Game (> $100b net worth):** ‚úÖ **Worth buying**
   - $5b is pocket change
   - Perfect accuracy helps with advanced optimization
   - Nice to have for precise calculations

**Verdict:** ‚è≥ **BUY WHEN AFFORDABLE - Enhances existing scripts but not critical.**

Your regular scripts are excellent. The formulas versions provide **marginal improvements** (2-5% accuracy gain). Buy when $5 billion feels cheap, not when it's a major expense.
