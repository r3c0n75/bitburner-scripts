## Batch Management Scripts

### simple-batcher.js
**Purpose**: Deploy attack helpers across reachable servers
**Usage**: `run simple-batcher.js <target> [capThreads] [--include-home] [--quiet] [--dry]`
**Parameters**:
- `target` - Server to attack
- `capThreads` - Maximum threads per server (optional)
- `--include-home` - Include home server in operations
- `--quiet` - Reduce output verbosity
- `--dry` - Show what would happen without executing

**Examples**:
```bash
run simple-batcher.js joesguns
run simple-batcher.js joesguns 100
run simple-batcher.js joesguns --include-home --quiet
run simple-batcher.js joesguns --dry
```

### batch-manager.js
**Purpose**: Enhanced batch manager with auto-rooting and intelligent quiet mode - deploys smart-batcher.js
**Usage**: `run batch-manager.js [target] [hackPercent] [multiplier] [pservHost] [flags...]`
**Parameters**:
- `target` - Server to attack (default: joesguns)
- `hackPercent` - Percentage of server money to hack per batch (default: 0.05 = 5%)
- `multiplier` - Batch timing multiplier (default: 1.25)
- `pservHost` - Host for batch manager (default: home)
- `flags` - Special flags:
  - `--quiet` - Suppress routine messages (rooting notifications still shown)
  - `--no-root` - Disable automatic server rooting

**Features**:
- üöÄ Automatically deploys 490x more efficient smart-batcher
- üîÑ Monitors for new servers every 10 cycles
- üéØ Only redeploys when new servers are rooted (not every cycle)
- ü§´ Intelligent quiet mode: full output once, then silent until changes
- üí∞ Leverages optimal timing-based thread ratios (4% hack / 87% grow / 9% weaken)
- ‚ö° 3-4x faster server preparation

**Examples**:
```bash
run batch-manager.js joesguns 0.05 1.25 home --quiet  # Recommended
run batch-manager.js joesguns --quiet --no-root       # Disable auto-rooting
run batch-manager.js --quiet                          # Use all defaults (5% hack)
```

**Intelligent Quiet Mode Behavior** ü§´:
- **Initial deployment**: Shows full smart-batcher output (timing, ratios, summary)
- **Continuous monitoring**: Stays completely silent while monitoring
- **New servers rooted**: Shows rooting notifications + triggers full redeployment
- **Perfect for**: Long-term automated management while you level up
- Errors/warnings: Always visible regardless of quiet mode

### smart-batcher.js ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
**Purpose**: Intelligent batch deployment with optimal timing-based thread ratios
**Performance**: 490x improvement over basic batching ($4k/s ‚Üí $2.09m/s)
**Usage**: `run smart-batcher.js <target> [hackPercent] [--include-home] [--quiet] [--dry]`

**Parameters**:
- `target` - Server to attack (required)
- `hackPercent` - Percentage of server money to hack per batch (default: 0.05 = 5%)
- `--include-home` - Include home server in deployment
- `--quiet` - Reduce output verbosity
- `--dry` - Show analysis and plan without deploying

**Key Innovation**: 
Calculates optimal thread ratios based on timing analysis instead of arbitrary allocation:
```
Traditional: 25% hack / 45% grow / 30% weaken (inefficient)
Smart:        4% hack / 87% grow /  9% weaken (optimal)
```

**Features**:
- üìä Intelligent ratio calculator based on security mechanics
- ‚öñÔ∏è Timing analysis (batch window, efficiency)
- üí∞ Production estimates (expected income after prep)
- üéØ Customizable hack percentage
- üìà Beautiful formatted output with deployment summary
- ‚ö° 3-4x faster server preparation time

**Examples**:
```bash
run smart-batcher.js joesguns              # Deploy with optimal ratios (5% hack)
run smart-batcher.js joesguns 0.10         # Hack 10% of server per batch
run smart-batcher.js joesguns --dry        # Test analysis without deploying
run smart-batcher.js joesguns --quiet      # Quiet deployment mode
run smart-batcher.js joesguns --include-home  # Include home server
```

**Real Performance**:
- Deployed across 56 servers
- 1304 threads (45 hack / 1119 grow / 140 weaken)
- Server prepped to 97% in 6 minutes
- Sustained **$2.09m/s** production ($7.5 billion/hour)

**Why It Works**:
1. Grow operations take 3-4x longer than hack
2. Needs proportionally more grow threads to maintain balance
3. 87% grow allocation enables exponential money growth
4. Server reaches max money 3-4x faster
5. Minimal hack threads (4%) - all that's needed when server is full

run profit-scan-flex.js                    # DEFAULT: Current state, money servers, top 30
run profit-scan-flex.js --optimal          # Rank by POTENTIAL (find hidden gems!)
run profit-scan-flex.js 50 --optimal       # Show top 50 by potential
run profit-scan-flex.js --all              # Show ALL servers (including purchased/home)

  - Best for: Large fleets (100-2000 threads) needing high-capacity targets

**Prep Status Indicators**:
- ‚úì READY - At/near min security, farm immediately
- ‚óê LIGHT PREP - Needs weakening (security delta > 50% of min)
- ‚ö† HEAVY PREP - Needs significant prep (security delta > 200% of min)

**Real-World Example (v1.5.3 - Fixed)**:
```
Current Rankings:           Fleet Potential Rankings:
1. silver-helix 16.91k/s    1. phantasy        Score: 196k ($600m)

3. joesguns     10.83k/s    3. omega-net       Score: 146k ($1.59b) ‚≠ê
4. sigma-cosmetics 9.70k/s  4. max-hardware    Score: 145k ($250m)
5. phantasy      7.09k/s    ...
                            10. sigma-cosmetics Score: 91k  ($57.5m)
```

**Key Insight**: silver-helix (#2) is often better than phantasy (#1) because:
